# Student-Career-Prediction
Performed Machine Learning Algorithms on the dataset.</br>
Analysed and trained the dataset and found out that Naive Bayes Algorithm gives highest accurate
percentage.</br>
To show the prediction we created a website and API where students will fill various fields such as marks etc.
and will show the career which is best suited for them.</br>
Used Pandas, Numpy, matplotlib, sklearn for prediction and Bootstrap for website.
